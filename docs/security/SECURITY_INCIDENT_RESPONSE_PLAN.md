## 3. Incident Response Team Structure

The incident response team is organized into core and extended support roles. Each role has defined responsibilities and designated contacts to ensure a coordinated response to security incidents. The team includes an Incident Commander, Technical Lead, Security Analyst, Communications Coordinator, Legal Counsel, and additional support from executives, system administrators, DevOps engineers, database administrators, and external consultants as needed.

## 4. Incident Classification

Incidents are classified by severity, with clear descriptions, examples, response times, and escalation procedures. This ensures that all incidents are handled appropriately and that critical issues receive immediate attention.

The plan is reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the organization, technology, and threat landscape.
