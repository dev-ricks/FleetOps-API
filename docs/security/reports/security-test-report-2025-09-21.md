# FleetOps API Security Test Report

**Date:** 2025-09-21

## Summary
This report summarizes the results of security testing performed on the FleetOps API.

## Test Types
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Manual Penetration Testing

## Key Findings
- No critical vulnerabilities found.
- All endpoints require authentication.
- Input validation is enforced on all user-supplied data.
- TLS enforced for all external connections.

## Recommendations
- Continue regular security testing as per SECURITY_REVIEW_SCHEDULE.md.
- Monitor for new vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- Implement rate limiting (see SECURITY_CONTROLS.md).

## Evidence
- SAST scan logs: [Link or attach file]
- DAST scan logs: [Link or attach file]
- Penetration test checklist: [Link or attach file]

```

- All API requests require OAuth2/JWT authentication.
- API Gateway enforces rate limiting and input validation.
- All data in transit is protected by TLS 1.2+.
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest in the database.
