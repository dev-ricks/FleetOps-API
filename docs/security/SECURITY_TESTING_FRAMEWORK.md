# Security Testing Frameworkâ€”FleetOps API

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security testing framework for FleetOps API, designed to validate security requirements through Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. The framework is organized by implementation phases to support incremental security enhancement.

## Testing Philosophy

- **Security-First TDD**: Security tests are written before implementing security features to ensure requirements are met from the start.
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls are tested to provide comprehensive protection.
- **Continuous Validation**: Automated security testing is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure ongoing compliance.
- **Compliance Driven**: All tests are designed to validate regulatory and industry compliance requirements.

## Test Categories & Structure

### 1. Authentication & Authorization Tests
These tests verify that only authorized users can access protected resources, and that authentication mechanisms (such as OAuth2 and JWT) are correctly implemented. They also ensure that role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced and that token validation is robust.

### 2. Data Protection Tests
These tests focus on ensuring that sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. They also verify that data masking and protection of personally identifiable information (PII) are in place, and that the database is secured against unauthorized access.

### 3. Input Validation & Injection Prevention Tests
These tests ensure that all user inputs are properly validated to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks. They also check that request sizes are limited to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

Each category includes both unit and integration tests, and all tests are maintained as part of the automated test suite for the project. The security testing framework is regularly reviewed and updated to address new threats and compliance requirements.
