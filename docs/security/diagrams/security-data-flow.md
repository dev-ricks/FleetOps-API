# FleetOps API Security Data Flow Diagram

This document describes the data flow and security boundaries for the FleetOps API. For a visual diagram, see the PNG or PlantUML file in the assets directory.

## Overview

The FleetOps API is designed with multiple security layers to protect sensitive data as it moves through the system. The following describes the flow of data and the security controls applied at each stage.

## Data Flow Steps

1. **Client Authentication**: The client (web or mobile app) authenticates with the identity provider and receives a JWT token.
2. **API Gateway**: All requests from the client pass through the API Gateway, which enforces HTTPS (TLS 1.2+), validates the JWT, and applies rate limiting and input validation.
3. **FleetOps API**: The API receives validated requests, enforces role-based access control (RBAC), and processes business logic. Sensitive data is encrypted before being stored.
4. **Database**: All data at rest in the database is encrypted (AES-256 or equivalent). Only the API can access the database directly.
5. **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant events are logged at each stage for monitoring and compliance.

## Security Boundaries
- All external communication is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+).
- JWT tokens are validated at the gateway and API layers.
- Only authorized users and services can access protected resources.
- Sensitive data is encrypted at rest in the database.
