# FleetOps API Security Architecture Diagram

This document describes the high-level security architecture for the FleetOps API. For a visual diagram, see the corresponding PNG or PlantUML file in the assets directory.

## Overview

The FleetOps API is designed with a layered security architecture to protect sensitive fleet data, ensure regulatory compliance, and provide robust access control. The architecture leverages modern security best practices, including OAuth2/JWT authentication, TLS encryption, and defense-in-depth strategies.

## Key Security Components

- **API Gateway**: Enforces authentication, rate limiting, and input validation for all incoming requests.
- **OAuth2 Resource Server**: Validates JWT tokens and enforces role-based access control (RBAC) for protected endpoints.
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256 or equivalent).
- **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant events are logged for monitoring, compliance, and forensic analysis.
- **Infrastructure Security**: Application and database servers are isolated in secure network segments, with firewalls and minimal open ports.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Regular backups and tested disaster recovery procedures ensure data integrity and availability.

## Data Flow Summary

1. Clients authenticate and obtain JWT tokens from the identity provider.
2. All API requests pass through the API Gateway, which validates tokens and applies security controls.
3. The FleetOps API validates the JWT, enforces RBAC, and processes the request.
4. Sensitive data is encrypted before storage and decrypted only for authorized access.
5. All access and modification events are logged for auditing.
