# Disaster Recovery Plan â€“ FleetOps API

## 1. Executive Summary

This Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) outlines the strategies, procedures, and responsibilities for recovering the FleetOps API and its supporting infrastructure in the event of a disaster. The goal is to minimize downtime, data loss, and business impact, ensuring continuity of critical fleet management operations.

## 2. Purpose and Scope

This plan covers all components of the FleetOps API, including application servers, databases, storage, and supporting services (e.g., Kafka, Redis, CI/CD). It applies to both production and staging environments.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                    | Responsibility                                |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Disaster Recovery Lead  | Overall coordination and decision-making      |
| IT Operations           | Infrastructure restoration, backup management |
| DevOps Engineers        | Application deployment and configuration      |
| Database Administrators | Database backup and restoration               |
| Communications Lead     | Internal and external communications          |
| Security Lead           | Security and compliance oversight             |

## 4. Recovery Objectives

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** 4 hours for critical services
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** 15 minutes for transactional data

## 5. Backup and Restoration Procedures

- Full database backups are performed nightly; incremental backups every 15 minutes.
- Application and configuration backups are performed daily.
- Backups are stored in geographically separate, secure locations (cloud and offsite).
- Restoration procedures are documented and tested quarterly.

## 6. Disaster Scenarios and Response Steps

### 6.1 Data Center Outage
- Failover to a secondary cloud region
- Restore the latest backups to standby infrastructure
- Validate application and data integrity

### 6.2 Database Corruption or Loss
- Isolate the affected database
- Restore from the most recent valid backup
- Reapply transaction logs if needed
- Validate data consistency

### 6.3 Application Server Failure
- Redeploy application containers from the CI / CD pipeline
- Restore configuration from backup
- Validate service health and connectivity

### 6.4 Security Incident (e.g., Ransomware)
- Isolate affected systems
- Initiate incident response plan
- Restore clean backups to new infrastructure
- Conduct forensic analysis before resuming operations

## 7. Communication Plan

- Notify a disaster recovery team and key stakeholders immediately
- Provide regular status updates to leadership and affected users
- Prepare public or customer communications as needed
- Document all actions and decisions for post-incident review

## 8. Testing and Maintenance

- Disaster recovery drills are conducted semi-annually
- Backup restoration tests are performed quarterly
- The DRP is reviewed and updated annually or after major changes
